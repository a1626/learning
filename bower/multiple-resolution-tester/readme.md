This project is to test how **local dependencies** works in bower and also if resolution of a dependent project affects master project.

**Conclusion**

    - You can use local dependecies(Please change bower.json's path of dependent project if you use it in some other machine)(haven't tried relative path yet).
    - __Update__: Using relative path also works and it saves dependency as relative path
    - Resolutions of current project matters only.
